              "We are excited to announce the 7th edition of Algebraic Topology: Computation, Methods, and Science (ATMCS) scheduled from 25-29 July, 2016 in Turin, Italy!  This conference is a joint effort of the Polytechnic University of Turin (Politecnico di Torino) and the ISI Foundation, to be hosted at the Politecnico.\n\nATMCS is a biennial conference series on algebraic topology with an important focus on its role in computer science and applications.  The 1st edition was held in 2001 at Stanford University in California, USA with subsequent editions held at international, transatlantic institutions.\n\nApplied and computational topology refers to the adaptation of classical topological theory and techniques to other fields of science and engineering.  A key goal in the conference series is the further development of topological techniques for use in applications and the creation of new areas of applications in the subject.  This conference series maintains a strong tradition of bringing together leading established researchers and young scientists in this emerging discipline, prov"

              "2015-08-17 to 2015-08-28\nUniversity of Victoria\n\nThis conference aims to bring together applied topologists and spatial statisticians that are curious about each-other's work.  We anticipate having two relatively-distinct groups: 1) topologists that have been working with applied algebraic-topological tools like persistent homology, 2) statisticians working in the area of high-dimensional data analysis, and researchers from fields that involve large data problems.  We aim to have as many general-interest talks as possible but as talks get more technical and special-interest we might see some parallel sessions aimed towards one particular audience. The other principal aspect of the conference is the first week we will have talks aimed primarily at a graduate student audience, covering the most basic topics in algebraic topology, persistent homology, and the basics of the fields people are applying these topics to, such as economics, brain imaging and genomics."
