Of course, other presentation software could be used; I use PowerPoint for its drawing and animation tools.\n\nAfter preparing my slides, I use the free software ActivePresenter to record a video of my presentation. ActivePresenter is able to capture the slides on my computer screen and audio as I narrate the slides; other similar software is available. For high-quality audio, I use a desktop microphone (I have a Blu Snowball mic) rather than the built-in mic on my laptop. I then use ActivePresenter to for minor video editing, checking for mistakes and correcting any I "

This channel will have two primary purposes:\n1. To supplement our seminar series in helping our community members keep up with research of other members.\n2. To help popularize TDA among people outside our community.\n3. To help everyone advertise their work via short videos.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions for specific topics you would like covered in a video, please suggest them right here in this Forum.  Feel free to also post links to videos that you have either made or found to be informative.\n\nIf you would like to contact us directly, please send email me (Harish, harishkumar.ch@gmail.com) or Don (don.r.sheehy@gmail.com).  We are happy to upload or link your existing videos to this new YouTube channel.\n\nOnce we have a critical mass of videos, we will be more aggressive in advertising the channel in many venues."

We anticipate having two relatively-distinct groups: 1) topologists that have been working with applied algebraic-topological tools like persistent homology, 2) statisticians working in the area of high-dimensional data analysis, and researchers from fields that involve large data problems.  We aim to have as many general-interest talks as possible but as talks get more technical and special-interest we might see some parallel sessions aimed towards one particular audience. The other principal aspect of the conference is the first week we will have talks aimed primarily at a graduate student audience, covering the most basic topics in algebraic topology, persistent homology, and the basics of the fields people are applying these topics to, such as economics, brain imaging and genomics."
