# Muut2RSS

The goal of this project is to create a web service that can create an RSS feed
from [compTop's muut](https://muut.com/comptop).

It turns out that it is quite easy to add other muuts.  If you would like to
have your muut added, please send me an email.

For those that are curious about how this works, all the interesting code is
in `muut-to-rss.js`.

Enjoy! Feel free to contributed or pass on suggestions.
